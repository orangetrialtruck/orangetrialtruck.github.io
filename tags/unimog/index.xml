This time, I decided to use RC components instead of the LEGO PF-compatible system to get proportional steering and driving. The truck also features a two-speed gearbox with a center differential that automatically locks in low gear. The gearbox layout is similar to the <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-v04/" rel="">Land Rover Defender v4</a>, so the ratios are the same - 1:1 in hi gear and 1.67:1 in low gear. The truck is powered by four PF-compatible motors that provide decent speed and torque. For steering, I used a Geek Servo motor, and another Geek Servo motor is used for shifting the gearbox.
The model is powered by a 3S LiPo battery (3x18650) which is located above the rear axle for better weight distribution.</p>
<p>The chassis dimensions are the same as the original <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/8110-1/unimog-u400/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">8110 Unimog U400</a> set. Instead of the fake engine, an L-motor is installed for the front PTO.</p>
<p>The cabin is almost the same as in the <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v03/" rel="">previous version</a>, only the passenger seat became wider.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>8110 Unimog MOD v3 - Orange trial truck</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v03/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 05:00:32 +0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v03/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is the third (and final, for now) version of my trial truck built from the LEGO <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/8110-1/unimog-u400/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">8110 Unimog U400</a> set. In this version, I managed to fix some issues with the chassis and improve the overall appearance. Thanks to <a href="https://rebrickable.com/parts/92908/technic-steering-portal-axle-housing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">portal hubs</a> and new differentials, the truck is powerful enough, but at the same time it&rsquo;s not a crawler, it&rsquo;s fun to play with both inside and outside.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>8110 Unimog MOD, v2</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v02/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 01:21:32 +0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v02/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>The first version of the <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v01/" rel="">Unimog 8110</a> was staying on the shelf for almost a year before I decided to improve it.</p>
<p>The front and rear axles remain the same. I added a second XL motor for driving and connected them both to the center differential. Unlike the original set, I decided to use a <a href="https://rebrickable.com/parts/62821b/technic-gear-differential-with-inner-tabs-and-closed-center-28-bevel-teeth-beveled-edge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">28 bevel tooth differential</a> here. The reason for this decision is the easier placement and connection of the XL motors.</p>
<p>I took non-original XL motors, which have higher RPM than the original ones, to achieve higher speed.  The truck also got a center differential lock activated by a CaDA micromotor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the center differential turned out to be a weak point. Due to the lack of support, it sometimes made a crackling sound under load, especially when changing driving direction. A possible solution I thought of is to add two beams on the left and right instead of 14 tooth gears. But in this case, I would have lost the ability to lock the differential, which is necessary for the trial truck.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>8110 Unimog MOD, v1</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v01/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 22:15:01 +0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v01/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is my first modification of the LEGO <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/8110-1/unimog-u400/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">8110 Unimog U400</a> set. I bought it on the secondary market without the pneumatic parts and decided to turn it into a trial truck. I kept the original exterior and interior, removed the transfer case, and added separate motors for the front and rear power take-off (PTO), as well as one PF XL motor for driving and a servo motor for steering.</p>
<p>However, it turned out that one XL motor was not enough for its scale. It would also be desirable to have a greater reduction on the wheels than 3:1. Additionally, the CaDA battery block quickly drains, which worsens the playability. I don&rsquo;t want to stop at this version and will try to improve its characteristics.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
