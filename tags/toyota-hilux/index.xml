This was my first time building not an official LEGO set, but someone&rsquo;s model (MOC) from a ready-made instruction. The building process was nice - the instructions are clear and easy to follow. I really like the model, it looks beautiful on the shelf and at the same time has excellent playability.</p>
<p>I added custom LED lights (front and rear), modified the steering mechanism a bit (to fit a non-original servo motor that can only turn 90Â°) and replaced regular cardan joints with the metal ones.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
