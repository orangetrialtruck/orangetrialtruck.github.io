Instead of the original Land Rover Defender body, I opted for a lighter and more attractive design. I came across an excellent <a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-35068" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">MOC-35068</a> on Rebrickable which I based my solution on. I sacrificed the back door for the strength of the body.</p>
<p>I really like the resulting model, it has excellent playability. Thanks to the two-speed RC gearbox, it can move quickly on high gear and easily overcome obstacles on low gear. <a href="https://rebrickable.com/parts/46490/wheel-hub-with-planetary-gear-reduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Wheel hubs with planetary gear reduction</a> provide excellent &ldquo;off-road&rdquo; capability, and the car&rsquo;s weight balance makes it easy to climb 40-degree slopes. The weak point of the chassis - a protruding 16-tooth gear - is covered with an overlay made of curved slopes that protects the gear when passing obstacles. The center differential enables smooth turns, while the robust chassis and gearbox prevent gear slipping and crunching when driving over obstacles. Additionally, the RC winch is powerful enough to pull the model.</p>
<p>The LED headlights look very natural, there are no visible wires on the outside.
When they&rsquo;re turned off, they&rsquo;re almost indistinguishable from the headlights on the original model. Both the headlights and the taillights are bright enough for driving in the dark.</p>
<p>The model also looks great on the shelf. I used non-original PF receivers operating at 2.4 GHz, this made it possible to completely hide them inside of the body. The LiPo battery is also hidden inside. The power switch is located inside the decorative gray trunk. I used black 3L pins instead of blue ones in all visible places and covered the holes in the technic beams with system plates.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>42110 Land Rover Defender chassis, v0.3</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-chassis-v03/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2022 19:45:47 +0100</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-chassis-v03/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>The third version of the Land Rover Defender chassis. To date, this is the most successful version. All functions work well, the gearbox does not slip even under load. The connection between the servo motor and the steering rack is half that of the previous version, resulting in less steering play. Let&rsquo;s see how the chassis will behave after adding the Land Rover&rsquo;s massive body!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>42110 Land Rover Defender chassis, v0.2</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-chassis-v02/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 10:12:47 +0100</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-chassis-v02/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is the second version of the Land Rover Defender chassis. Compared to the <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-chassis-v03/" rel="">first version</a>, it now features Ackermann steering and some changes were made to the gearbox and transmission.</p>
<p>Despite all efforts, the design of the gearbox and transmission turned out to be not reliable enough; when passing over obstacles (even in low gear), it sometimes made a crackling noise. The weight balance was also far from ideal - the rear part of the chassis was heavier than the front. After adding a body, the weight balance would shifted back even more. The steering mechanism also needs to be improved - it has too much play</p>
<p>It was a good start, but I decided to take this chassis apart and look for a better solution.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>42110 Land Rover Defender chassis, v0.1</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-chassis-v01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 17:10:47 +0100</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-chassis-v01/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is my first attempt at motorizing the LEGO<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/42110-1/land-rover-defender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">42110 Land Rover Defender</a> set. It features two PF L motors for driving and a servo motor for steering. I used non-original motors (Red Furious), which have higher RPM than the original ones, to achieve higher speed. The center differential is absent. The two-speed gearbox is shifted by a CaDA micro motor.</p>
<p>All functions work fine, but I am disappointed with the performance and reliability of this version - the gears sometimes slip and crunch when driving over obstacles. Also, there is too much play in the steering mechanism.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
