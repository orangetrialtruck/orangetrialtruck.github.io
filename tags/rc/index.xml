The <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/wrangler-v01/" rel="">previous one</a> was built with Power Functions, had 2 L-motors and a gearbox. In the new version I decided to focus on power and playablity so I put 4 L-motors for driving and used RC electoronics to get proportinal steering and driving. The 4 L-motors layout idea was inspired by the <a href="https://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?/forums/topic/188469-moc-jeep-wrangler/&amp;tab=comments#comment-3471625" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Jeep Wrangler</a> model by Daniel-99.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Setting up 4WS (4 wheels steering) on FlySky GT3C with alternative firmware</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/flysky-gt3c-crab-config/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 23:59:59 +0100</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/flysky-gt3c-crab-config/</guid><description>In this video I show how to setup 4 wheels steering (4WS) and switching between front / full / rear steering modes on a FlySky GT3C radio with alternative firmware.

This time, I decided to use RC components instead of the LEGO PF-compatible system to get proportional steering and driving. The truck also features a two-speed gearbox with a center differential that automatically locks in low gear. The gearbox layout is similar to the <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-v04/" rel="">Land Rover Defender v4</a>, so the ratios are the same - 1:1 in hi gear and 1.67:1 in low gear.The truck is powered by four PF-compatible motors that provide decent speed and torque. For steering, I used a Geek Servo motor, and another Geek Servo motor is used for shifting the gearbox.</p>
<p>The chassis dimensions are the same as the original <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/8110-1/unimog-u400/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">8110 Unimog U400</a> set. Instead of the fake engine, an L-motor is installed for the front PTO.</p>
<p>The cabin is almost the same as in the <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v03/" rel="">previous version</a>, only the passenger seat become wider.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
