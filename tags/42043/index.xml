My goal was to keep all the features of the original model, its exterior and interior and, at the same time, make the model nice to play with.
Chassis For the motorization, I decided to use RC-electronics because both the receiver and the ESC are very compact and can be hidden somewhere in the body. The GeekServo motor used for steering is also compact, leaving more space in the chassis.</description></item></channel></rss>
