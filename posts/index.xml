The <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/wrangler-v01/" rel="">previous one</a> was built with Power Functions, had 2 L-motors and a gearbox. In the new version I decided to focus on power and playablity so I put 4 L-motors for driving and used RC electoronics to get proportinal steering and driving. The 4 L-motors layout idea was inspired by the <a href="https://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?/forums/topic/188469-moc-jeep-wrangler/&amp;tab=comments#comment-3471625" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Jeep Wrangler</a> model by Daniel-99.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Setting up 4WS (4 wheels steering) on FlySky GT3C with alternative firmware</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/flysky-gt3c-crab-config/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 23:59:59 +0100</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/flysky-gt3c-crab-config/</guid><description>In this video I show how to setup 4 wheels steering (4WS) and switching between front / full / rear steering modes on a FlySky GT3C radio with alternative firmware.

This time, I decided to use RC components instead of the LEGO PF-compatible system to get proportional steering and driving. The truck also features a two-speed gearbox with a center differential that automatically locks in low gear. The gearbox layout is similar to the <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-v04/" rel="">Land Rover Defender v4</a>, so the ratios are the same - 1:1 in hi gear and 1.67:1 in low gear.The truck is powered by four PF-compatible motors that provide decent speed and torque. For steering, I used a Geek Servo motor, and another Geek Servo motor is used for shifting the gearbox.</p>
<p>The chassis dimensions are the same as the original <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/8110-1/unimog-u400/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">8110 Unimog U400</a> set. Instead of the fake engine, an L-motor is installed for the front PTO.</p>
<p>The cabin is almost the same as in the <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v03/" rel="">previous version</a>, only the passenger seat become wider.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>42082 Rough Terrain Crane Full RC MOD</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42082-red-crane-v01/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 06:00:19 +0800</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42082-red-crane-v01/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is my MOD of the official <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/42082-1/rough-terrain-crane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">42082</a> set.

<p>This model is based on and inspired by two great models: <a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-30015/Sheepo/jeep-wrangler-rubicon-manual-version/#details" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">MOC - Jeep Wrangler Rubicon</a> by Sheepo and <a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-92929/gyenesvi/42129-c-model-jeep-wrangler/#details" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">MOC - 42129 C model - Jeep Wrangler</a> by Viktor Gyenes.</p>
<p>I opted for the black and yellow color scheme, but since some of the original parts do not exist in yellow or black, I decided to use non-original ones. I also used black 3L pins instead of blue ones in all visible places. The model got 85x28mm RC tyres on black rims.<br>
I tried to make both interior and exterior interesting, but at the same time not so detailed to keep the model not heavy. The curb weight of the model is 1.63 kg, which is almost 400 grams less than the <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-v04/" rel="">42110 Land Rover Defender, v4</a>.</p>
<p>I used non-original PF receivers operating at 2.4 GHz, which allowed them to be completely hidden under the hood. The LiPo battery is located behind the seats.</p>
<p>The gearbox and both differentials are protected by panels.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Tatra 813 6x6 Chassis v1</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/tatra-813-6x6-chassis-v01/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2023 19:00:00 +0800</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/tatra-813-6x6-chassis-v01/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Attempt to make a Tatra 813 6x6 chassis. The design of the axles and transmission was taken from the <a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-109209/Horcikdesigns/pdf-8x8-tatra-t813-trial-truck/#details" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">8x8 Tatra T813 Trial truck</a> by Horcikdesigns. I used 2 L motors for propulsion and a servo motor for steering. The left and right drivetrains are independent of each other. The chassis has a two-speed gearbox shifted by an M motor.<br>
The chassis demonstrated excellent performance, but the steering turned out to be a weak point. There is too much play, especially on the second axle - adding a second steering rack could potentially solve this issue.<br>
Another problem is wheel alignment. The wheels on the front axle have a negative toe angle, on the second axle - positive. Maybe it&rsquo;s not that essential for an offroad truck, but these steering things somehow dampened my motivation, and I decided to postpone the model until better times.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>8110 Unimog MOD v3 - Orange trial truck</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v03/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 05:00:32 +0800</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v03/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is the third (and final, for now) version of my trial truck built from the LEGO <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/8110-1/unimog-u400/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">8110 Unimog U400</a> set.

Thanks to <a href="https://rebrickable.com/parts/92908/technic-steering-portal-axle-housing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">portal hubs</a> and new differentials, the truck is powerful enough, but at the same time it&rsquo;s not a crawler, it&rsquo;s fun to play with both inside and outside.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>My garage, #2 - return of the Unimog</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/mygarage-mar-2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2023 19:00:01 +0800</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/mygarage-mar-2023/</guid><description>This week my garage on the shelf looks like this: Toyota Hilux, Land Rover Defender and &amp;hellip; the orange gentleman is back! I completed the modification of the Unimog and am happy with the result (well, at least for now). I hope I will find time soon and take cool pictures and maybe a video.
42082 MOD I have started to modify the 42082 (Rough Terrain Crane). The plans are to make it fully RC.</description></item><item><title>8110 Unimog MOD, v2</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v02/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 01:21:32 +0800</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v02/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>The first version of the <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v01/" rel="">Unimog 8110</a> was staying on the shelf for almost a year before I decided to improve it.</p>
<p>The front and rear axles remain the same. I added a second XL motor for driving and connected them both to the center differential. Unlike the original set, I decided to use a <a href="https://rebrickable.com/parts/62821b/technic-gear-differential-with-inner-tabs-and-closed-center-28-bevel-teeth-beveled-edge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">28 bevel tooth differential</a> here. The reason for this decision is the easier placement and connection of the XL motors.</p>
<p>I took non-original XL motors, which have higher RPM than the original ones, to achieve higher speed.  The truck also got a center differential lock activated by a CaDA micromotor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the center differential turned out to be a weak point. Due to the lack of support, it sometimes made a crackling sound under load, especially when changing driving direction. A possible solution I thought of is to add two beams on the left and right instead of 14 tooth gears. But in this case, I would have lost the ability to lock the differential, which is necessary for the trial truck.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
