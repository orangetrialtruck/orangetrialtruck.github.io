My goal was to keep all the features of the original model, its exterior and interior and, at the same time, make the model nice to play with.
Chassis For the motorization, I decided to use RC-electronics because both the receiver and the ESC are very compact and can be hidden somewhere in the body. The GeekServo motor used for steering is also compact, leaving more space in the chassis.</description></item><item><title>Wrangler Rubicon, v2 (with 4L motors and RC electronics)</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/wrangler-v2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 17:00:59 +0100</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/wrangler-v2/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is the second version of my Wrangler Jeep. The <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/wrangler-v01/" rel="">previous one</a> was built with Power Functions, had 2 L-motors and a gearbox. In the new version I decided to focus on power and playability so I put 4 L-motors for driving and used RC electronics to get proportional steering and driving. The 4 L-motors layout idea was inspired by the <a href="https://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?/forums/topic/188469-moc-jeep-wrangler/&amp;tab=comments#comment-3471625" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Jeep Wrangler</a> model by Daniel-99.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Setting up 4WS (4 wheels steering) on FlySky GT3C with alternative firmware</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/flysky-gt3c-crab-config/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 23:59:59 +0100</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/flysky-gt3c-crab-config/</guid><description>In this video I show how to setup 4 wheels steering (4WS) and switching between front / full / rear steering modes on a FlySky GT3C radio with alternative firmware.

This time, I decided to use RC components instead of the LEGO PF-compatible system to get proportional steering and driving. The truck also features a two-speed gearbox with a center differential that automatically locks in low gear. The gearbox layout is similar to the <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-v04/" rel="">Land Rover Defender v4</a>, so the ratios are the same - 1:1 in hi gear and 1.67:1 in low gear. The truck is powered by four PF-compatible motors that provide decent speed and torque. For steering, I used a Geek Servo motor, and another Geek Servo motor is used for shifting the gearbox.
The model is powered by a 3S LiPo battery (3x18650) which is located above the rear axle for better weight distribution.</p>
<p>The chassis dimensions are the same as the original <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/8110-1/unimog-u400/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">8110 Unimog U400</a> set. Instead of the fake engine, an L-motor is installed for the front PTO.</p>
<p>The cabin is almost the same as in the <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v03/" rel="">previous version</a>, only the passenger seat became wider.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>42082 Rough Terrain Crane Full RC MOD</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42082-red-crane-v01/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 06:00:19 +0800</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42082-red-crane-v01/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is my MOD of the official <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/42082-1/rough-terrain-crane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">42082</a> set. Like many others, I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the playability of the original set, so I decided to improve it.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Wrangler Rubicon, v1</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/wrangler-v01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 23:59:59 +0100</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/wrangler-v01/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>After finishing the <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-v04/" rel="">42110 Land Rover Defender, v4</a>, I decided to build a classic Wrangler Jeep Rubicon which would be lighter and more off-road capable.</p>
<p>This model is based on and inspired by two great models: <a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-30015/Sheepo/jeep-wrangler-rubicon-manual-version/#details" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">MOC - Jeep Wrangler Rubicon</a> by Sheepo and <a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-92929/gyenesvi/42129-c-model-jeep-wrangler/#details" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">MOC - 42129 C model - Jeep Wrangler</a> by Viktor Gyenes.</p>
<p>I opted for the black and yellow color scheme, but since some of the original parts do not exist in yellow or black, I decided to use non-original ones. I also used black 3L pins instead of blue ones in all visible places. The model got 85x28mm RC tyres on black rims.<br>
I tried to make both interior and exterior interesting, but at the same time not so detailed to keep the model not heavy. The curb weight of the model is 1.63 kg, which is almost 400 grams less than the <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-v04/" rel="">42110 Land Rover Defender, v4</a>.</p>
<p>I used non-original PF receivers operating at 2.4 GHz, which allowed them to be completely hidden under the hood. The LiPo battery is located behind the seats.</p>
<p>The gearbox and both differentials are protected by panels.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Tatra 813 6x6 Chassis v1</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/tatra-813-6x6-chassis-v01/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2023 19:00:00 +0800</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/tatra-813-6x6-chassis-v01/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Attempt to make a Tatra 813 6x6 chassis. The design of the axles and transmission was taken from the <a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-109209/Horcikdesigns/pdf-8x8-tatra-t813-trial-truck/#details" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">8x8 Tatra T813 Trial truck</a> by Horcikdesigns. I used 2 L motors for propulsion and a servo motor for steering. The left and right drivetrains are independent of each other. The chassis has a two-speed gearbox shifted by an M motor.<br>
The chassis demonstrated excellent performance, but the steering turned out to be a weak point. There is too much play, especially on the second axle - adding a second steering rack could potentially solve this issue.<br>
Another problem is wheel alignment. The wheels on the front axle have a negative toe angle, on the second axle - positive. Maybe it&rsquo;s not that essential for an offroad truck, but these steering things somehow dampened my motivation, and I decided to postpone the model until better times.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>8110 Unimog MOD v3 - Orange trial truck</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v03/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 05:00:32 +0800</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/8110-unimog-v03/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is the third (and final, for now) version of my trial truck built from the LEGO <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/8110-1/unimog-u400/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">8110 Unimog U400</a> set.

I completed the modification of the Unimog and am happy with the result (well, at least for now). I hope I will find time soon and take cool pictures and maybe a video.
42082 MOD I have started to modify the 42082 (Rough Terrain Crane). The plans are to make it fully RC.</description></item></channel></rss>
