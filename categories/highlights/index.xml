The 42082 (Rough Terrain Crane) is on the top shelf - it is going to be rebuilt soon into a full RC MOD.</description></item><item><title>42110 Land Rover Defender, v0.4</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-v04/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 23:59:59 +0100</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-v04/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is the final version of my motorized Land Rover Defender 42110, featuring the <a href="https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/42110-landrover-chassis-v03/" rel="">v0.3 chassis</a>. Instead of the original Land Rover Defender body, I opted for a lighter and more attractive design. I came across an excellent <a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-35068" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">MOC-35068</a> on Rebrickable which I based my solution on. I sacrificed the back door for the strength of the body.</p>
<p>I really like the resulting model, it has excellent playability. Thanks to the two-speed RC gearbox, it can move quickly on high gear and easily overcome obstacles on low gear. <a href="https://rebrickable.com/parts/46490/wheel-hub-with-planetary-gear-reduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Wheel hubs with planetary gear reduction</a> provide excellent &ldquo;off-road&rdquo; capability, and the car&rsquo;s weight balance makes it easy to climb 40-degree slopes. The weak point of the chassis - a protruding 16-tooth gear - is covered with an overlay made of curved slopes that protects the gear when passing obstacles. The center differential enables smooth turns, while the robust chassis and gearbox prevent gear slipping and crunching when driving over obstacles. Additionally, the RC winch is powerful enough to pull the model.</p>
<p>The LED headlights look very natural, there are no visible wires on the outside.
When they&rsquo;re turned off, they&rsquo;re almost indistinguishable from the headlights on the original model. Both the headlights and the taillights are bright enough for driving in the dark.</p>
<p>The model also looks great on the shelf. I used non-original PF receivers operating at 2.4 GHz, this made it possible to completely hide them inside of the body. The LiPo battery is also hidden inside. The power switch is located inside the decorative gray trunk. I used black 3L pins instead of blue ones in all visible places and covered the holes in the technic beams with system plates.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Toyota Hilux</title><link>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/toyota-hilux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2023 10:00:01 +0800</pubDate><author>orangetrialtruck.nl</author><guid>https://orangetrialtruck.nl/posts/toyota-hilux/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>The model was designed by <a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-126570/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">RM8 LEGO Garage - BrickGarage</a>. This was my first time building not an official LEGO set, but someone&rsquo;s model (MOC) from a ready-made instruction. The building process was nice - the instructions are clear and easy to follow. I really like the model, it looks beautiful on the shelf and at the same time has excellent playability.</p>
<p>I added custom LED lights (front and rear), modified the steering mechanism a bit (to fit a Chinese servo motor that can only turn 90Â°) and replaced regular cardan joints with the metal ones.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
