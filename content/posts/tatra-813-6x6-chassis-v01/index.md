Attempt to make a Tatra 813 6x6 chassis. The design of the axles and transmission was taken from the [8x8 Tatra T813 Trial truck](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-109209/Horcikdesigns/pdf-8x8-tatra-t813-trial-truck/#details) by Horcikdesigns. I used 2 L motors for propulsion and a servo motor for steering. The left and right drivetrains are independent of each other. The chassis has a two-speed gearbox shifted by an M motor.\
The chassis demonstrated excellent performance, but the steering turned out to be a weak point. There is too much play, especially on the second axle - adding a second steering rack could potentially solve this issue.\
Another problem is wheel alignment. The wheels on the front axle have a negative toe angle, on the second axle - positive. Maybe it's not that essential for an offroad truck, but these steering things somehow dampened my motivation, and I decided to postpone the model until better times.

* high: 20:16 -> 16:16 (final ratio: 1:1.25)
