I began my LEGO Technic journey in the summer of 2021 by motorizing the [42075 First Responder](https://rebrickable.com/sets/42075-1/first-responder/) set. I added motors for driving and steering, and also installed custom LEDs. Overall, I'm happy with the result as the car has great playability - especially in the dark, thanks to the bright LEDs. Of course, there's always room for improvement.
