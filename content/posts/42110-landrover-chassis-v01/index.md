This is my first attempt at motorizing the LEGO [42110 Land Rover Defender](https://rebrickable.com/sets/42110-1/land-rover-defender/) set. It features two PF L motors for driving and a servo motor for steering. I used non-original motors (Red Furious), which have higher RPM than the original ones, to achieve higher speed. The center differential is absent. The two-speed gearbox is shifted by a CaDA micro motor.

All functions work fine, but I am disappointed with the performance and reliability of this version - the gears sometimes slip and crunch when driving over obstacles. Also, there is too much play in the steering mechanism.
