This is the third (and final, for now) version of my trial truck built from the LEGO [8110 Unimog U400](https://rebrickable.com/sets/8110-1/unimog-u400/) set. In this version, I managed to fix some issues with the chassis and improve the overall appearance. Thanks to [portal hubs](https://rebrickable.com/parts/92908/technic-steering-portal-axle-housing/) and new differentials, the truck is powerful enough, but at the same time it's not a crawler, it's fun to play with both inside and outside.

## Chassis

The main difference with the [previous version]({{< ref "/posts/8110-unimog-v02" >}}) is the absence of a center differential. The motors are now rigidly connected through the [knobs](https://rebrickable.com/parts/32072/technic-knob-wheel/), which has slightly increased the speed and significantly improved the transmission's reliability - the gears no longer slip or crunch even on tough obstacles.\
As in the [previous version]({{< ref "/posts/8110-unimog-v02" >}}), I took non-original XL motors (Red Furious), which have higher RPM than the original ones, to achieve higher speed. And I painted the motors black.

I also added custom LED headlights and taillights. They are always on when the power is on, but since they have standard PF connectors, they can be connected through a separate [PF switch](https://rebrickable.com/parts/61929c02/pole-reverser-power-functions-black-wire/).

Both PTOs are functional and operate from separate motors (front - L motor, rear - M motor). The motors can be activated using [PF switches](https://rebrickable.com/parts/61929c02/pole-reverser-power-functions-black-wire/) located on the right side of the chassis. Adding another PF receiver would allow remote control of both PTOs. The attachment points for the PTOs remain unchanged, so it is possible to connect a winch and other non-pneumatic accessories designed for the original 8110 set.

All motors and electronics (receivers, lights, LiPo battery) are located inside the chassis. I used non-original PF receivers that operate at 2.4 GHz. The truck has a low center of gravity, which ensures maximum stability.\
Both the cabin and the truck body are purely decorative elements, making it easy to reuse the chassis for another model.

The [9.5L shock absorbers](https://rebrickable.com/parts/95292c01/technic-shock-absorber-95l-with-extra-hard-spring/) were replaced with non-original black ones, and many chassis parts were also replaced with black ones for a better look. I also added decorative steps on both sides of the cabin. The functional four-cylinder fake engine remained unchanged. The suspension articulation remains the same as in the original set.

## Cabin and truck body

The cab was slightly modified - the beacons were removed, the holes in the roof and floor were completely covered up, and the HOG was also removed. The cab can be tilted, providing access to the fake engine. When closed, it is securely fixed to the chassis with convenient latches.\
Instead of the original gray panel body, I made a lightweight orange trial-style body. It has a tilting rear gate and an opening bottom lid for accessing the electronics. I used black 3L pins instead of blue ones in all visible places and covered the holes in the technic beams with system panels.

## Specs 
* Steering: PF Servo motor, based on [MOC-3286](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-3286/jb70/8110-unimog-moc-rc/#details)
* Propulsion: 2 * PF XL motors (non-original, "Red Furious")
* 4x4 drive, no center differential
* Open differentials in axles (no locks)
* Turning diameter (by wheels): 132cm
* Front PTO: PF L motor
* Rear PTO: PF M motor
* Both PTO motors are activated by separate PF switches
* Without pneumatics
* 2 PF receivers - 2 receivers operate on the same channel and each controls its own XL motor
* Custom front and rear LED lights. The LEDs are always on, but since they have standard PF connectors, they can easily be connected via PF switches.
* Powered by 3 x 18650 LiPo batteries with a DC step down converter
* Curb weight: 2.15 kg (without batteries - 1,95 kg)

### Gearing: 

1:1 (knobs in the center) -> 12:28 (new differentials in axles) -> 8:24 (portals)\
Final ratio: 6.99:1
