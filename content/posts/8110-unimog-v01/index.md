This is my first modification of the LEGO [8110 Unimog U400](https://rebrickable.com/sets/8110-1/unimog-u400/) set. I bought it on the secondary market without the pneumatic parts and decided to turn it into a trial truck. I kept the original exterior and interior, removed the transfer case, and added separate motors for the front and rear power take-off (PTO), as well as one PF XL motor for driving and a servo motor for steering. 

However, it turned out that one XL motor was not enough for its scale. It would also be desirable to have a greater reduction on the wheels than 3:1. Additionally, the CaDA battery block quickly drains, which worsens the playability. I don't want to stop at this version and will try to improve its characteristics.
