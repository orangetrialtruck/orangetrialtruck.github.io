This is the fourth version of my trial truck built from the LEGO [8110 Unimog U400](https://rebrickable.com/sets/8110-1/unimog-u400/) set. This time, I decided to use RC components instead of the LEGO PF-compatible system to get proportional steering and driving. The truck also features a two-speed gearbox with a center differential that automatically locks in low gear. The gearbox layout is similar to the [Land Rover Defender v4]({{< ref "/posts/42110-landrover-v04" >}}), so the ratios are the same - 1:1 in hi gear and 1.67:1 in low gear.The truck is powered by four PF-compatible motors that provide decent speed and torque. For steering, I used a Geek Servo motor, and another Geek Servo motor is used for shifting the gearbox.

The chassis dimensions are the same as the original [8110 Unimog U400](https://rebrickable.com/sets/8110-1/unimog-u400/) set. Instead of the fake engine, an L-motor is installed for the front PTO.

The cabin is almost the same as in the [previous version]({{< ref "/posts/8110-unimog-v03" >}}), only the passenger seat become wider.
