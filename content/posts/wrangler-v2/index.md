This is the second version of my Wrangler Jeep. The [previous one]({{< ref "/posts/wrangler-v01" >}}) was built with Power Functions, had 2&nbsp;L-motors and a gearbox. In the new version I decided to focus on power and playablity so I put 4&nbsp;L-motors for driving and used RC electoronics to get proportinal steering and driving. The 4&nbsp;L-motors layout idea was inspired by the [Jeep Wrangler](https://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?/forums/topic/188469-moc-jeep-wrangler/&tab=comments#comment-3471625) model by Daniel-99.

The new version doesn't have a gearbox, because all the space is taken by 4&nbsp;L-motors. Technically, I could change the layout - lift the motors up and put the gearbox underneath - but, firstly, I didn't want to spoil the interior, and secondly, this would increase weight of the model, which I wanted to keep as low as possible.

To increase the playability, I decided to make the 4 wheels steering (4WS). Each axle got its own GeekServo motor. I configured my FlySky GT3C radio to easily switch between the 4 steering modes: full/crab/front/rear. 

A small note about the FlySky GT3C radio - it doesn't support 4WS out of the box. Luckily, there is [alternative firmware](https://github.com/semerad/gt3b/blob/master/Releases/MANUAL-0.6.1.txt) the for GT3B and GT3C radios, that provides a lot of nice options, including the 4WS. The latest version, 0.6.1 was released in 2012, but it's still actual! The Internet is full of information about installing and configuring this alternative firmware, but I couldn't find a good one about setting up the 4WS, so I made a step-by-step [video instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcxo5ueoPmU) with my setup. 

## Electronics

I managed to fit all the electronics (receiver, ESC and battery) under the hood. I like this setup not only because the interior is 'clean' of wires/electrics, but also because the weight distribution is better - the heaviest components are in the front. The downside is there is no room for a fake engine.
The model also got custom LEDs - headlights and taillights.

## Bodywork

The bodywork ideas was mostly taken from the great MOC [Jeep Wrangler - 42129 alternate](https://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?/forums/topic/188452-moc-rc-jeep-wrangler-42129-alternate) by gyenesvi and also took some ideas from the Sheepo's [Jeep Wrangler Rubicon](https://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?/forums/topic/136712-moc-jeep-wrangler-rubicon-jk/). I built the model in yellow color, most of parts are taken from the [42114 Volvo Articulated Hauler](https://rebrickable.com/sets/42114-1/6x6-volvo-articulated-hauler/) set. 

I wanted the body to be all yellow and black, but unfortunately some parts don't exist in the colors I needed. I prefer to use only original LEGO bricks, but I don't hesitate to use aftermarket parts if don't see any other solution. For this case, I took [Technic Axle Pin with Friction Ridges](https://rebrickable.com/parts/43093/technic-axle-pin-with-friction-ridges-lengthwise/) in black color, [Technic Pin Connector Round 1L](https://rebrickable.com/parts/18654/technic-pin-connector-round-1l-beam/) in yellow and [Technic Pin Long with Friction Ridges](https://rebrickable.com/parts/32054/technic-pin-long-with-friction-ridges-lengthwise-and-stop-bush-3-lateral-holes-big-pin-hole/) also in yellow.

In the end, I really like the result - the model exceeded my expectations in terms of playability! And I'm also happy with the bodywork - it's not overloadad with details, but at the same time not too simple.
