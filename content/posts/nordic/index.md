This is my first attempt at building a wooden RC model ship. The plans were published in the Polish magazine “Modelarz” #6 1969 - “Holownik Klimek”.

I decided to build this particular model because the available drawings are quite detailed and also include the outlines of all the parts - the keel, frames, wheelhouse, etc. There are also many photos and videos of this model on the internet, which simplifies things for a beginner. And, of course, I love tugboats!

This is not a copy model, I simplified or omitted some details due to lack of experience or to save time. My goal was to make a model in a reasonable amount of time and refresh my woodworking and modeling skills.

The keel and frames are laser-cut from 4mm birch plywood. All other parts are hand-cut from 2mm poplar plywood. The hull is sealed with epoxy resin both inside and outside, then primed and painted with oil paint.
The wheelhouse is easily removable, providing access to the electronics and motor. The deck, which is fastened with screws, can also be removed for maintenance or inspection.

The boat is powered by two 18560 cells. The motor (it’s just a regular 12V dc motor) turned out to be too powerful, so at full throttle the boat moves like a racing boat, not a tugboat, but that’s good in terms of playability. 
The black plastic propeller doesn't look quite authentic, but for this model, I decided to leave it as it is; for the next one I'll get a brass one.
