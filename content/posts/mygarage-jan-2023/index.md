This week my garage on the shelf looks like this: [Toyota Hilux]({{< ref "/posts/toyota-hilux" >}}), [Land Rover Defender]({{< ref "/posts/42110-landrover-v04" >}}) and [disassembled Unimog]({{< ref "/posts/8110-unimog-v01" >}}).

The [42082 (Rough Terrain Crane)](https://rebrickable.com/sets/42082-1/rough-terrain-crane/) is on the top shelf - it is going to be rebuilt soon into a full RC MOD.
