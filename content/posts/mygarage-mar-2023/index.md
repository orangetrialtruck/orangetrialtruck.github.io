This week my garage on the shelf looks like this: [Toyota Hilux]({{< ref "/posts/toyota-hilux" >}}), [Land Rover Defender]({{< ref "/posts/42110-landrover-v04" >}}) and ... the orange gentleman is back! I completed the modification of the [Unimog]({{< ref "/posts/8110-unimog-v02" >}}) and am happy with the result (well, at least for now). I hope I will find time soon and take cool pictures and maybe a video.

### 42082 MOD

I have started to modify the [42082 (Rough Terrain Crane)](https://rebrickable.com/sets/42082-1/rough-terrain-crane/). The plans are to make it fully RC. The first step - disassembling the stock version - is done!
